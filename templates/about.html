                    <p>Hi, I’m <b>Aditya Murali</b>, a passionate and self-driven <b>Data Analyst</b> based in Navi Mumbai, India. With a strong academic foundation in <b>Computer Science</b> and a <b>Master’s in Data Analytics</b>,
                        I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive meaningful outcomes. I’m deeply curious about data and how it can be used to solve real-world problems, optimize processes, and guide smart decision-making.</p>

                    <p>During my internship at <b>RERA Easy</b>, I applied my technical and analytical skills to real-world challenges. I developed a full-stack <b>HR Analytics Tool</b> to automate employee data analysis, built dynamic dashboards for HR metrics,
                        and automated data extraction using <b>web scraping tools like Selenium and Beautiful Soup</b>. I also gained deployment experience by hosting web apps on platforms like <b>Heroku and Render</b>, ensuring smooth user access and performance.</p>

                    <p>In addition to professional experience, I’ve worked on several academic projects including <b>Laptop Price Prediction</b>, <b>Sentiment Analysis</b> using NLP, and an interactive <b>Student Performance Dashboard</b>. These projects not only sharpened my skills in
                        <b>Python, machine learning, data visualization, and Flask</b>, but also taught me the importance of presenting data in a meaningful and user-friendly way.</p>

                    <p>I have a strong grasp of tools and technologies like <b>Power BI, SQL, MySQL, Plotly, and Dash</b>, and I’m always eager to learn more. I enjoy collaborating with teams, communicating insights clearly, and building solutions that make a measurable impact.
                        My approach combines critical thinking with creativity to solve problems and turn messy data into meaningful stories.</p>

                    <p>I'm actively seeking exciting opportunities in <b>Data Analytics, Data Science, or Business Intelligence</b> roles within industries like <b>IT, BFSI, consulting, or tech startups</b>. I’m driven by curiosity, powered by data, and always ready to take on new challenges.</p>
